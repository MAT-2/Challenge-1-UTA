# Challenge-1-UTA

Challenge one of the UT Austin Full Stack Bootcamp Coding Bootcamp.

## Description

Module 1 challenge helps to simulate refactoring existing starter code in order for the web application to be accessible for more users who may have disabilities.
This helped reinforce the importance of providing semantic HTML elements, which helps users to read the webpage easily compared to using non-semantic HTML elements.
The process of refactoring helps me appreciate how important it is to have a web application that is readeable for more users, and making sure the new changes/updates
works with the existing code.
